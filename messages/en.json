        "faq2Q": "How to analyze links safely (without click risk)?",
        "faq2A": "Use \"safe mode\": copy the link address without opening it (right-click → \"Copy link address\") and paste for analysis. Alternatively, send a screenshot of the message for OCR evaluation. This reduces the risk of opening malicious content.",
        "faq3Q": "Does MetaScope \"confirm\" if something was made by AI?",

        "faq5Q": "Does location (GPS) always appear?",
        "faq5A": "No. Geolocation is only displayed when the file contains EXIF GPS data. Many platforms remove metadata when reprocessing images.",
        "faq6Q": "What is SHA-256 hash and why does it matter?",
        "faq6A": "It is a \"fingerprint\" of the file. It serves to verify integrity and support the traceability of the analyzed material.",
        "faq7Q": "What does MetaScope check in suspicious links and screenshots?",
        "faq7A": "It looks for signs of phishing and fraud (e.g. homography/IDN, typosquatting, artificial urgency and social engineering manipulation). When available, it can cross-reference information with external reputation sources for corroboration.",
